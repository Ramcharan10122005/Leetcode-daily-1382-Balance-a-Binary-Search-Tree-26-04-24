# Leetcode-daily-1382-Balance-a-Binary-Search-Tree-26-04-24
Given the root of a binary search tree, return a **balanced** binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return **any of them**.

A binary search tree is **balanced** if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]

**Output:** [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]

**Explanation:** This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.

**Input:** root = [2,1,3]

**Output:** [2,1,3]
 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105
